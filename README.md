# [Mango Care](https://github.com/chriisong/MangoCareDemo)
**Mango Care** is a Personal Health Record app that enables patients to keep a well-organized record of their prescriptions, blood glucose values, blood pressure values, weight measurements, and clinic appointments, and set alerts to remind them to take their prescriptions, measure their health indices, and attend their appointments. Patients will then be able to share their data with their medical professionals in order to receive appropriate coaching and prescription adjusting to better suit their current health trend. SongCare stores all sensitive data in private CloudKit containers not only to keep the data secure, but also to allow ease of use when operating from different device. SongCare allows for unimpeded access to a patient’s own medical record and will play a bigger role in the growing telemedicine industry.

#### Technology: Core Data, CloudKit, UNNotification, Diffable Data Source, REST API
#### 3rd Party Libraries: FSCalendar, YPImagePicker, Charts

# [Hub](https://github.com/chriisong/GitHubFollowers)

[Hub](https://github.com/chriisong/GitHubFollowers) is a take-home project by [Sean Allen](https://github.com/sallen0400). It is a GitHub follower app that quickly searches for a list of followers for a given username using GitHub’s public API. With the retrieved followers list, users can further access the follower’s GitHub profile using SFSafariView and retrieve the follower’s own follower list. Upon completion of the course, I have added some additional features such as Core Data and CloudKit capabilities, additional view controllers for smoother user experience, and changing the `FavouritesVC` to be UITableViewDiffableSource.
