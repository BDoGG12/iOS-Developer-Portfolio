# Hub

[Hub](https://github.com/chriisong/GitHubFollowers) is a take-home project by [Sean Allen](https://github.com/sallen0400). Upon completion of the course, I have added some additional features such as Core Data and CloudKit capabilities, additional view controllers for smoother user experience, and changing the `FavouritesVC` to be UITableViewDiffableSource.

#### Technology: Diffable Data Source, Core Data, CloudKit, No 3rd-Party Libraries, Result Type, REST API

# SongCare
**SongCare** is a personal project that I have started as a means to dig deeper into Swift and challenge myself to publish on the App Store. My father, who is a surgeon in Korea, and I architectured this app together, with our combined passion and plans for an improved health care system wherein patients can have direct and unimpeded access to their own health data, and wherein doctors, patients, and other healthcare professionals can have smoother and secure delivery of information and requests. This app is a small piece of a bigger scheme of this desire for improved health care system.

This app is still in beta testing phase. There are still a lot of features and functions to be added, bugs to be fixed, and refactoring to be done.

#### Technology: Core Data, CloudKit, UNNotification, Diffable Data Source, REST API
#### 3rd Party Libraries: FSCalendar, YPImagePicker, PanModal, Charts
